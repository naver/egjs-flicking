## HTML structure
- To support SSR(Server Side Rendering), Flicking no longer generates viewport & camera element.
- So you have to create a viewport & camera element in your HTML template yourself.
- Also, now you have to import CSS file we're providing and place a correct class names
  - We're now using `flicking-viewport` and `flicking-camera` instead of `eg-flick-viewport` and `eg-flick-camera`
- All framework-based Flickings don't have to consider this change, as they're still generating inner elements for you.
```html {2,5-6,10-11}
<head>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/@egjs/flicking@4.0.0/dist/flicking.css">
</head>
<body>
  <div id="my-flicking" class="flicking-viewport">
    <div class="flicking-camera">
      <div>Panel 1</div>
      <div>Panel 2</div>
      <div>Panel 3</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</body>
```
```js
const flicking = new Flicking("#my-flicking");
```

## Changes when using umd modules
- We've removed `eg` namespace on umd modules.
  - `eg.Flicking` is now just `Flicking`

## Removed Options
- CSS-related options
  - To support SSR, we've removed all CSS-related properties to guarantee UI when rendered in SSR frameworks.
  - **gap**
    - You can now set gaps between panels with CSS margins like `margin-right` or `margin-bottom`.
  - **zIndex**
    - You can now directly use CSS `z-index` to viewport element(`.flicking-viewport`) instead.
  - **overflow**
    - You can set `overflow: visible` to viewport element(`.flicking-viewport`) instead.
- **infinite** and **lastIndex**
  - `needPanel` event is now always triggered without the option **infinite**
- **collectStatistics**
- **thresholdAngle**
- **isEqualSize** and **isConstantSize**
- **anchor** and **hanger** is now merged into the new option named **align**.
  - `anchor: 20` and `hanger: "40%"` is same to `align: { panel: 20, camera: "40%" }`
- **infiniteThreshold** is now renamed to **needPanelThreshold**

## Removed methods
- **replace**
  - As Flicking no longer supports isolated indexes, we've removed Flicking's **replace** and added **prepend** and **insert** instead.
- Getters
  - We're now usinge a getter property instead of `get-` methods
  - **getIndex()** > **index**
  - **getAllPanels()** > **panels**
  - **getElement()** > **element**
  - **getCurrentPanel()** > **currentPanel**

## Option Changes
- **adaptive** is now only applicable when `horizontal: true`
- **moveType** is now always a `string`

## Option's default value changes
- Default value of **duration** is now `500` (was `100`)
- Default value of **bounce** is now `20%` (was `[10, 10]`)
- Default value of **autoResize** is now `true` (was `false`)

## Method Changes
- **addPlugins** and **removePlugins** do not longer accept arrays

## Event Changes
- **needPanel** is now can be triggered on the index 0
  - It always has `direction: "PREV"`
- We don't longer provide the method **fill()** in **needPanel** event
  - As all panels now have continuous indexes, you can use `prepend()` or `append()` instead
