### Before
Flicking is based on es5 and additionally needs es6 Promise to work properly.
es5 is basically supported on IE9+ ([Source](http://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es5/))
So, only es6 Promise is needed to run Flicking on the older browsers.

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/es6-promise/dist/es6-promise.auto.js"></script>
```

Adding the above script will make Flicking run on the older browsers.

* How to use it via CDN (For personal or internal use)
```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/es6-promise/dist/es6-promise.auto.js"></script>
```
* How to use it yourself (Unlike individual or internal cases, CDN has unpredictable problems with services, so it is better to use your own files.)

# Download

require('es6-promise').polyfill();
```
